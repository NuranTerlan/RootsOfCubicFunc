# RootsOfCubicFunc

  # ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 ( `func` )

This program can calculate roots of any cubic function and work absolutely perfect ( it's mean that it work dynamicly ). 
It work on the console ( computer terminal ) and tell you for example enter the coefficients of cubic function => ` a, b, c, d ` =>
( ` ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 ` ), and so on. 
  This is my programming labwork ( ASOIU => Information Technology ( ***I Degree*** ) )   ...
