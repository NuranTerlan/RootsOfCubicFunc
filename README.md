# RootsOfCubicFunc

This program can calculate roots of any cubic function and work absolutely perfect ( it's mean that it work dynamicly ). 
It work on the console ( computer terminal ) and tell you for example enter the coefficients => a, b, c, d ( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 )
and so on. This is my programming labwork ( ASOIU => Information Technology ( I Degree ) )
